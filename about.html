    	<h1> About </h1>
   	 	<p>The Southern Mensurationists is an informal group of forest biometricians, 
    	mensurationists, statisticians, mathematicians, modelers, and others interested 
    	in various aspects of quantitative forestry. The International Conference on 
    	Forest Measurements and Quantitative Methods and Management meet periodically 
    	(approximately at five-year intervals) in conjunction with a Southern 
    	Mensurationists meeting. Past conferences of these two groups have provided a 
    	diverse range of presentations given by professionals and students. The level of 
    	presentation is often diverse, but we welcome talks designed to be accessible to 
    	all, without sacrificing content. Graduate students are especially encouraged to 
    	use this venue as a friendly place to get feedback on their proposed research 
    	work or work in progress. </p>
