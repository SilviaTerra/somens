            <p>We’ve tried to keep the <em>student rate low</em> to encourage student participation and presentations.
              We will have a shorter presentation format for students so that those that are early in their
              research programs will still have an opportunity to present and get feedback.

              <strong>Travel:</strong>
              The Atlanta Airport (ATL) is approximately a 1.5 hour drive from Athens.  No need to rent a car or deal with traffic,
              there is a <em>reasonably priced shuttle</em> that will take you from the airport terminal directly to the hotel,
              and then back again.  We’ll be at the hotel for the duration of the conference (or within short walking distance for dinner).
              The shuttle service is provided by Groome Transportation
              (<a href="http://athens.groometransportation.com" target="_blank">http://athens.groometransportation.com</a>),
              be sure to indicate you want drop-off and pickup at the Hotel Indigo.

              The Hotel Indigo is in the downtown area of Athens, GA and is adjacent to the main campus of the University of Georgia.
              The Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources is a short walk away (though the meeting will be held entirely at the Hotel Indigo).
